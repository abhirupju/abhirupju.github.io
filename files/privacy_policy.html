<center><h2>Privacy Policy</h2></center>
<p>
The Locmon app records highly sensitive personal data, which will identify the participants personally (by the location of their home address, workplace, and any other locations that he / she regularly visits), and that it will record every place he / she travels and every location that he / she visits, even briefly, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, wherever he / she carries the phone for a period of the duration of the study.
</p>

<p>
Because this data is highly sensitive, it will be sent to the secure servers via secure communication using HTTPS and stored on an encrypted disk drive. Any temporary decrypted copies made in the process of research analysis will be securely deleted immediately after each analysis session. A permanent record will be kept of the individuals who are given access to the decryption passwords, and that a participant can request a copy of that list at any time. A participant can control recording by enabling or disabling the location service in the phone; Opt out of the study by uninstalling the app; and request to delete his / her own data by emailing the provided ID. Upon delete request we shall delete all the traces of your data. We acknowledge that the location data can be engineered to infer sensitive information, but we will not derive any such information from the collected data. Moreover, we will keep the participant's personal identities (name and email addresses) separate from the collected data all the time.
</p>
<p>
In future, for research purposes a derived version of the location traces shall be shared with other research institutions under legal agreements to be drafted at the appropriate time. The derived data shall contain statistical and topological features extracted from the traces or suitably chosen parts of the traces so that the personal features become fuzzy. Example features would include the number of times a person turned more than 90 degrees in a day, etc. Although the exact features to include depends on the result of the analysis and will be decided later, we shall refrain from including any geometric feature (such as a time series of turn angles) that could lead to revealing locations in the map. For further general information about the University of Cambridgeâ€™s use of your personal data as a participant in a research study, please see <a href="https://www.information-compliance.admin.cam.ac.uk/data-protection/research-participant-data">here</a>. Please note that the legal basis for processing any personal data collected by this project is to perform a task in
the public interest, namely academic research.
